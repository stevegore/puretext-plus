## Description ##

PureText+ allows you to add a new Windows hot-key (default is WINDOWS+V) that allows you to paste text to any application without formatting.

## Original Version ##

The project is based on the original [PureText written by Steve P. Miller](http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/).   In 2011 Melloware wanted to make some minor changes to the code and realized that while PureText was FREE it was not open source.  So while working late one night I decided to attempt to recreate it from scratch in C# and this project is the result of that effort!

## License Info ##

PureText+ is Apache License 2.0 which is compatible with the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).

[Windows Input Simulator .NET Library](http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/) is used which is Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).

### Differences between PureText and PureText+ ###
  * Open Source with Apache License 2.0
  * Ability to hide tray icon (to re-enable change REG:\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Melloware\PureTextPlus\TrayIconVisible to 1)
  * Updated icon that looks nice in all Windows from 95 to Win7
